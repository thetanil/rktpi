## What it is

A platform for web apps running on YOUR Pi, with YOUR Data, accessible from YOUR phone.

Hi ruzi

## Features

- A guard computer for your phone
- A translator of documents
- An internet filtered of garbage
- A path out of the cloud
- Keep your own email, back it up ez

## The Questions

Rocket Pi is an attempt to answer the following questions:
- how can we get developers to build web apps which allow you to keep your data
- how can i legally show you your FB feed without all the garbage you didn't ever ask for
- why can't we have just email we can trust (spoiler: we can)

*many people want out of the cloud, but do not know how*

## But First...

### It's a game engine?
