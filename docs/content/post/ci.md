The rktpi as an end user product is heavily integrated into the CI system

this is only a first step to keep things simple.
beta testers and developers should share an environment as much as possible

the end user will configure a GH repo for their Raspberry Pi, and they will run our GH Actions
to bring their Pi into a working state for their own configuration.
